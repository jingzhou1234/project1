                    Silk Road, referred to as the Silk Road, generally refers to the Silk Road, broadly
                    speaking divided into Silk Road and the Maritime Silk Road .
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The Silk Road on the Land originated from the Western Han Dynasty (202-8 years ago).
                    Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Zhang Ye to open the Western Region . Starting
                    from the capital Chang'an (now Xi'an ), it passed through Gansu and Xinjiang to
                    Central Asia and Western Asia and connected the Mediterranean countries. Overland
                    passage. Its original function was to transport silk produced in ancient China.
                    In 1877, the German Geological geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen in his book "China,"
                    a book, the "from between 114 BC to AD 127 years, between China and Central Asia,
                    China and India silk trade as a medium of this The term "western traffic road" was
                    named "Silk Road", and the term was quickly accepted by academics and the general
                    public, and was officially used.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The " Maritime Silk Road " was an maritime passage between ancient China and foreign
                    transportation and cultural exchanges. This road was mainly centered on the South
                    China Sea, so it is also called the South China Sea Silk Road. The Maritime Silk
                    Road was formed in the Qin and Han dynasties, developed from the Three Kingdoms
                    to the Sui Dynasty, flourished in the Tang and Song dynasties, and changed in the
                    Ming and Qing dynasties. It is the oldest known maritime route.

                    On June 22, 2014, China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan jointly declared the eastern
                    section of the Silk Road on the land "Silk Road: Road Network of Chang'an-Tianshan
                    Corridor" successfully declared as a World Cultural Heritage , becoming the first

                    In September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the strategic idea of building
                    a " New Silk Road Economic Belt ". On March 28, 2015, the National Development and
                    Reform Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce
                    jointly issued the "Vision and Action for Promoting the Joint Development of the
                    Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road".

                    The Hexi Corridor is the main point of the Silk Road, but why is there no "Simen"
                    and "Jade Gate" on the Hexi Corridor? Long before the literature described the Silk
                    Road in 2000, the line of cultural exchange between the East and the West had been
                    opened, but it was not for exporting silk, but for importing Hetian jade [6] . The
                    name "Silk Road" is the "invention" of German scholars.

                    With the development of the times, the Silk Road became a collective name for all
                    the political, economic, and cultural communication channels between ancient China
                    and the West. Western Han Dynasty Zhang Qian opened the official channels of the
                    Western Regions "Northwest Silk Road"; there north to the Mongolian plateau and
                    then west of the Tianshan Mountains into the "Prairie Silk Road" in Central Asia;
                    Chang'an to Chengdu and then to India 's rugged Hill's "Southwest Silk The "Silk
                    Road" for maritime trade from Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and other
                    coastal cities, from the South Ocean to the Arabian Sea, and even as far as the
                    east coast of Africa.

                    The northern route started at Chang'an (now called Xi'an), an ancient capital of
                    China that was moved further east during the Later Han to Luoyang. The route was
                    defined around the 1st century BCE when Han Wudi put an end to harassment by nomadic
                    tribes.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The northern route travelled northwest through the Chinese province of Gansu from
                    Shaanxi Province and split into three further routes, two of them following the
                    mountain ranges to the north and south of the Taklamakan Desert to rejoin at Kashgar,
                    and the other going north of the Tian Shan mountains through Turpan, Talgar, and
                    Almaty (in what is now southeast Kazakhstan). The routes split again west of Kashgar,
                    with a southern branch heading down the Alai Valley towards Termez (in modern Uzbekistan)
                    and Balkh (Afghanistan), while the other travelled through Kokand in the Fergana
                    Valley (in present-day eastern Uzbekistan) and then west across the Karakum Desert.
                    Both routes joined the main southern route before reaching ancient Merv, Turkmenistan.
                    Another branch of the northern route turned northwest past the Aral Sea and north
                    of the Caspian Sea, then and on to the Black Sea.
