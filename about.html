                    Silk Road, referred to as the Silk Road, generally refers to the Silk Road, broadly
                    speaking divided into Silk Road and the Maritime Silk Road .
                    <br />
                    The Silk Road on the Land originated from the Western Han Dynasty (202-8 years ago).
                    Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Zhang Ye to open the Western Region . Starting
                    from the capital Chang'an (now Xi'an ), it passed through Gansu and Xinjiang to
                    Central Asia and Western Asia and connected the Mediterranean countries. Overland
                    passage. Its original function was to transport silk produced in ancient China.
                    In 1877, the German Geological geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen in his book "China,"
                    a book, the "from between 114 BC to AD 127 years, between China and Central Asia,
                    China and India silk trade as a medium of this The term "western traffic road" was
                    named "Silk Road", and the term was quickly accepted by academics and the general
                    public, and was officially used.
                    <br />
                    The " Maritime Silk Road " was an maritime passage between ancient China and foreign
                    transportation and cultural exchanges. This road was mainly centered on the South
                    China Sea, so it is also called the South China Sea Silk Road. The Maritime Silk
                    Road was formed in the Qin and Han dynasties, developed from the Three Kingdoms
                    to the Sui Dynasty, flourished in the Tang and Song dynasties, and changed in the
                    Ming and Qing dynasties. It is the oldest known maritime route.

                    On June 22, 2014, China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan jointly declared the eastern
                    section of the Silk Road on the land "Silk Road: Road Network of Chang'an-Tianshan
                    Corridor" successfully declared as a World Cultural Heritage , becoming the first

                    <br />
                    In September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the strategic idea of building
                    a " New Silk Road Economic Belt ". On March 28, 2015, the National Development and
                    Reform Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce
                    jointly issued the "Vision and Action for Promoting the Joint Development of the

                <p class="sec1 bili">
                    The Hexi Corridor is the main point of the Silk Road, but why is there no "Simen"
                    and "Jade Gate" on the Hexi Corridor? Long before the literature described the Silk
                    Road in 2000, the line of cultural exchange between the East and the West had been
                    opened, but it was not for exporting silk, but for importing Hetian jade [6] . The
                    name "Silk Road" is the "invention" of German scholars.
                    <br />
                    At the end of the 19th century, German geographer Li Hofen wrote in "China" that
                    "from 114 BC to 127 AD, China and Central Asia The term "traffic road" was named
                    "Silk Road", and the term was quickly accepted by academics and the general public,
                    and was officially used. Later, in the book "Ancient Silk Road between China and
                    Syria" published by the German historian Halmann in the early 20th century, the
                    Silk Road was further extended to the western Mediterranean Asia Minor determines
                    the basic connotation of the Silk Road, that is, it was the passage of land trade
                    exchanges between Central Asia and South Asia, West Asia, and Europe and North Africa
                    in ancient China.
                    <br />
                    The traditional Silk Road started from Changan , the ancient capital of China ,
                    and reached the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asian countries, Afghanistan,
                    Iran, Iraq, Syria, etc., ending in Rome with a total length of 6,440 kilometers.
                    This road is considered to be the intersection of ancient Eastern and Western civilizations
                    that connected Eurasia, and silk is the most representative cargo. For thousands
                    of years, nomadic peoples or tribes, businessmen, cult members, diplomats, soldiers,
                    and academic investigators have traveled along the Silk Road.
                    <br />
                    With the development of the times, the Silk Road became a collective name for all
                    the political, economic, and cultural communication channels between ancient China
                    and the West. Western Han Dynasty Zhang Qian opened the official channels of the
                    Western Regions "Northwest Silk Road"; there north to the Mongolian plateau and
                    then west of the Tianshan Mountains into the "Prairie Silk Road" in Central Asia;
                    Chang'an to Chengdu and then to India 's rugged Hill's "Southwest Silk The "Silk
                    Road" for maritime trade from Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and other
                    coastal cities, from the South Ocean to the Arabian Sea, and even as far as the
                    east coast of Africa.

                                The northern route started at Chang'an (now called Xi'an), an ancient capital of
                                China that was moved further east during the Later Han to Luoyang. The route was
                                defined around the 1st century BCE when Han Wudi put an end to harassment by nomadic
                                tribes.[127][citation needed]

                                The northern route travelled northwest through the Chinese province of Gansu from
                                Shaanxi Province and split into three further routes, two of them following the
                                mountain ranges to the north and south of the Taklamakan Desert to rejoin at Kashgar,
                                and the other going north of the Tian Shan mountains through Turpan, Talgar, and
                                Almaty (in what is now southeast Kazakhstan). The routes split again west of Kashgar,
                                with a southern branch heading down the Alai Valley towards Termez (in modern Uzbekistan)
                                and Balkh (Afghanistan), while the other travelled through Kokand in the Fergana
                                Valley (in present-day eastern Uzbekistan) and then west across the Karakum Desert.
                                Both routes joined the main southern route before reaching ancient Merv, Turkmenistan.
                                Another branch of the northern route turned northwest past the Aral Sea and north
                                of the Caspian Sea, then and on to the Black Sea.

                                The southern route or Karakoram route was mainly a single route from China through
                                the Karakoram mountains, where it persists in modern times as the Karakoram Highway,
                                a paved road that connects Pakistan and China.[citation needed] It then set off
                                westwards, but with southward spurs so travelers could complete the journey by sea
                                from various points. Crossing the high mountains, it passed through northern Pakistan,
                                over the Hindu Kush mountains, and into Afghanistan, rejoining the northern route
                                near Merv, Turkmenistan. From Merv, it followed a nearly straight line west through
                                mountainous northern Iran, Mesopotamia, and the northern tip of the Syrian Desert
                                to the Levant, where Mediterranean trading ships plied regular routes to Italy,
                                while land routes went either north through Anatolia or south to North Africa. Another
                                branch road travelled from Herat through Susa to Charax Spasinu at the head of the
                                Persian Gulf and across to Petra and on to Alexandria and other eastern Mediterranean
