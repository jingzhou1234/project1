                    A critique from your client:</p>
                <p class="sec1 bili">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person who is very interested in Chinese culture, this website shows me the history of the Silk Road and gave me a deeper understanding of the history of ancient China. But I think the design of this webpage is very simple, although the color of sand is used to increase that feeling. But the website overall is still too simple. In addition, the layout of the website is not very reasonable, you need to better allocate pictures and text, you can add more text to the patterns and insert some patterns into the text. What more, the classification of the website can be made clearer. However, the feedback on the last page of this page is well done, allowing clients to submit their own feedback, so that the web designer has room for improvement.
