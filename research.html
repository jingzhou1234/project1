                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose: Emperor Wu enlisted a ambassador to the Western Regions, preparing to contact
                    the Dayue clan who were rushed by the Huns from Hexi to the Western Regions, to
                    attack the Huns together. Zhang Jian, who was eager to contribute to the construction
                    of the country, resolutely applied.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    After: In 138 BC, he took more than a hundred followers from Chang'an to the west
                    and was caught by the Huns on the way, and detained for 11 years. Not forgetting
                    his mission, he managed to escape and tossed and reached Otsuki. At that time, Otsuki
                    had moved westward for a long time and had no intention of fighting the Hun again.
                    Zhang Huan returned to Chang'an and reported to the Emperor Han Wu the knowledge
                    of the Western Regions and their desire to communicate with the Han Dynasty.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Zhang Ye's Second Mission to the Western Regions: In 119 BC, Emperor Han Wu sent
                    Zhang Jian to the Western Region for the second time. Zhang Huan led a delegation
                    to visit many countries in the Western Regions with tens of thousands of cattle
                    and sheep and a large amount of silk. Countries in the Western Regions also sent
                    envoys to visit Chang'an. Communication between the Han Dynasty and the Western
                    Regions has become more frequent ever since.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The establishment of the Western Regions Duhuo: The Western Regions successively
                    belonged to the Han Dynasty. In 60 BC, the Western Han Dynasty established the Western
                    Regions Guardian, in charge of the Western Regions affairs. Since then, Xinjiang
                    has become under the jurisdiction of the central government and has become an integral
                    part of our country.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Ban Chao operated the Western Regions: In 73 AD, the Eastern Han Dynasty sent classes
                    beyond the Western Regions. He helped countries in the Western Regions get rid of
                    the control of the Xiongnu and was appointed by the Eastern Han Dynasty to protect
                    the Western Regions. He has operated in the Western Regions for 30 years and strengthened
                    the relationship between the Western Regions and the Mainland. Ban Chao once sent
                    Gan Ying to Da Qin, and Gan Ying reached the Persian Gulf. In 166, the envoy of
                    the Qin Dynasty came to Luoyang, which was the first direct exchange between European
                    countries and China.
